    You are the pilot of a cargo 
    cruiser, a hefty ship made for 
    transportation and light combat.

    Alone without crew, it is up to 
    you to survive in deep space, 
    hunted by pirates, armies, and 
    fortune-seekers hoping to take
    your cargo off your hands.

           Godspeed, pilot.
