# AmEn2
start of my 2nd attempt to create the Amulet Engine in python for terminal RPGs

Currently working with limited functionality. Game works well enough, but the scaling of enemies and the numbers behind the scenes are still in need of tweaking which may take a while. 

Multiplayer is not working yet, but you can create a localhost socket server in the menu and connect to it, it just doesn't do anything yet. If you want to connect from different machines, that can be changed by putting in the local IP in the client.py and server.py files under the HOST variable as a string (ie '127.x.x.xx'). But again, it's too early to need to do that as there's no multiplayer gameplay yet.

- RUN 'MAIN.PY' to play.
