# AmEn2
start of my 2nd attempt to create the Amulet Engine in python for terminal RPGs

Currently working with limited functionality. Game works well enough, but the scaling of enemies and the numbers behind the scenes are still in need of tweaking which may take a while. 

Multiplayer over sockets works at the moment, with the painful limitation that it can only be run on one machine. And by limitation I mean it works and it's unusable for it's intended purpose, which is two people playing on separate machines, but since it still runs and is playable, we're chalking that up as a success. Currently in the process of getting the socket to automatically assign the ip as your machines IPv4 but there's a bit of trouble in that I'm a socket newbie and don't know exactly how to get a server running on that address AND a client, and there's no way in hell I'm making people use a 3rd machine to run the server because that's about as useful as making the game run both clients on one machine- hah. 


- RUN 'MAIN.PY' to play.
