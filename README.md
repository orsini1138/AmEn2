# AmEn2
start of my 2nd attempt to create the Amulet Engine in python for terminal RPGs


- RUN 'MAIN.PY' to play.


So far so good- it's been updated months later now as of 11/13/19 with:
      - Critical Attacks and Misses: now rolls a d20 in the background with every attack for more varied combat and chance.
      - Scaling is a little bit better. Not great. But with the randomization, it's less of a curve and the combat is actually more dynamic and kind of fun.
      - The sockets aren't gonna happen. I'm not really trying to sink the time into them right now so that's just gonna stay dead.

** OLD INFO on SOCKETS **

Multiplayer over sockets works at the moment, with the painful limitation that it can only be run on one machine. And by limitation I mean it works and it's unusable for it's intended purpose, which is two people playing on separate machines, but since it still runs and is playable, we're chalking that up as a success. Currently in the process of getting the socket to automatically assign the ip as your machines IPv4 but there's a bit of trouble in that I'm a socket newbie and don't know exactly how to get a server running on that address AND a client, and there's no way in hell I'm making people use a 3rd machine to run the server because that's about as useful as making the game run both clients on one machine- hah.
